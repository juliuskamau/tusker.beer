<h4 class="Chivo-Black clear">1. Introduction</h4>
<p>This website is operated by a member of the Diageo group of companies, the ultimate holding company of which is Diageo plc (registered in England and Wales with company number 23307 and registered address at Lakeside Drive, London, NW10 7HQ, United Kingdom).</p>

<p>All references to 'our', 'us', 'we', or ‘company’ within this policy and within the opt-in notice are deemed to refer to Diageo plc, its subsidiaries, affiliates, and/or associates, as appropriate.</p>

<p>We endeavour to protect your personal privacy. We provide this Privacy and Cookie Notice to help you to understand what we may do with any personal information that we obtain from you. By providing your personal information to us, you signify your acceptance of our Privacy and Cookie Notice and agree that we may collect, use, and disclose your personal information as described in this Privacy and Cookie Notice. If you do not agree to this Notice, please do not provide your personal details to us. This Privacy and Cookie Notice is incorporated into, and part of, the Conditions of Use, that govern your use of the site in general. We will use your information only for the purposes set forth below.</p>

<p>We may need to update this Privacy and Cookie Notice from time to time. We recommend that you check this page regularly to ensure that you have read the most recent version.</p>

<h4 class="Chivo-Black clear"><em>2. </em>Legal purchase age</h4>

<p>You must not provide us with your personal information if you are not of legal age to purchase alcohol in the jurisdiction in which you reside and (if different) in the jurisdiction in which you are accessing the site. We do not intend to collect personal information from any individuals under the legal purchase age, or to market alcoholic beverages to anyone under the legal purchase age. If we receive notice or believe that someone under the legal purchase age has provided us with personal information we will make every reasonable effort to remove such personal information from ourrecords, or to flag such personal information and (to the extent permitted by law) retain it for the sole purpose of ensuring that it is no longer used.</p>

<h4 class="Chivo-Black clear">3. What is personal information?</h4>

<p>Personal information is information about an identifiable individual, as defined by applicable law. By 'personal information' we mean names, addresses, email addresses, payment information, and any other personal information you voluntarily provide, for example by entering a competition, completing an online questionnaire, or giving credit card details when purchasing products from us. We also collect some personal information automatically when you browse this website, such as your IP address and details of the pages that you have visited.</p>

<h4 class="Chivo-Black clear">4. Collecting personal information</h4>

<p>It is your choice to provide us with personal information. In certain instances, we may provide you with the option to select whether you would like to receive information from us or from trusted third parties (for example, by choosing to opt in or opt out of receiving special promotional offers). In some circumstances, you will not have the option to opt out, such as when we are satisfying the obligations of a contract with you, administering a transaction requested by you, or required by law.</p>

<p>You may choose to provide us with personal information if, for example, you: contact us with an enquiry; register on the site; forward an item to a friend; purchase an item; fill out a survey or other form with your personal information included; ask us to provide you with information; enter a competition; post information to public areas of the site; or take advantage of a promotion.</p>

<p>By providing any personal information to us, you fully understand and clearly consent to the transfer of such personal information to, and the collection and processing of such information in, other countries or territories. Any such transfer and processing by us will be in accordance with this Privacy and Cookie Notice.<strong> </strong></p>

<ol><li><strong>5. </strong><strong>IP Addresses</strong></li>
</ol><p>When your web browser or e-mail application requests a web page or e-mail from another computer on the Internet, it automatically gives that computer the address where it should send the information. This is called your computer's "IP address." (IP stands for "Internet protocol.") For most users accessing the Internet from a dial-up Internet service provider (ISP), the IP address will be different every time you log on. We receive IP addresses from all users because this information is automatically reported by your browser each time you view a web page.<strong> </strong>We do not store IP addresses in a central database. They are just recorded in log files so they are not associated with an account.</p>

<p>IP addresses may be used for various purposes, including to:</p>

<ul><li>to identify a person’s country access.</li>
    <li>To assist our third party service provider to manage GEO IP location, who may map IP addresses to countries.</li>
    <li>Diagnose service or technology problems reported by our users or engineers that are associated with the IP addresses controlled by a specific web company or ISP.</li>
    <li>Send the most appropriate advertising based on geographic area or information derived from your IP address. Many IP addresses are commonly associated with Internet service providers, universities, or major corporations in specific regions or localities. Aggregate information derived from IP addresses may also be reported to advertisers.</li>
    <li>Estimate the total number of users visiting our websites from specific countries or regions of the world.</li>
    <li>Assist third party advertisers to track effectiveness of the promotions they run on our website, visits to and business at third party's websites.</li>
    <li>Help determine which users have access privileges to certain content that we host.</li>
</ul><h3>6. Cookies</h3>

<p>Like many other websites, we use "cookies" to help us gather and store information about visitors to our websites. This notice provides you with information about how we use cookies and how you can control them. By using this website you accept the use of cookies in accordance with this notice. If you do not accept the use of these cookies, please see the section below entitled ‘How do I disable/enable cookies?’ for further instructions.</p>

<p>A cookie is a text-only string of information that a website transfers to the cookie file of the browser on your computer's hard disk so that the website can track unique visitors, recognise returning visitors and remember a visitor’s preferences. A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the "lifetime" of the cookie, and a value, usually a randomly generated unique number. Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognise a user’s device.</p>

<p>Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improving the user experience. They can also help to ensure that adverts you see online are more relevant to you and your interests. You can find more information about cookies at: <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</p>

<ol><li><strong>7. </strong><strong>What types of cookies are used on this site?</strong></li>
</ol><p>We use two broad categories of cookies:</p>

<ul><li><strong>First party cookies</strong>, served directly by us to your computer.</li>
    <li><strong>Third party cookies</strong>, served by a third party on our behalf. We use third party cookies to help us analyse our websites and their uses, and to enable tailored advertising.</li>
</ul><ol><li><strong>8. </strong><strong>What do we use cookies for? </strong></li>
</ol><p><strong>Category 1: Strictly Necessary Cookies </strong></p>

<p>These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the website. Without these cookies services you have asked for, like shopping baskets or e-billing, cannot be provided.</p>

<ol><li><strong>9. </strong><strong>What type of Strictly Necessary Cookies do we use on our website?</strong></li>
</ol><p>Examples of Strictly Necessary Cookies we may use on this website include Content Management Cookies which are required by the site for the content management system to work and Template Preference Cookies which are necessary for mobile sites and enable the site to look and feel the way it is intended to.</p>

<p>We may also use a Social Sharing Cookie. This is a cookie that identifies you with social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter and allows interaction between your activity on social networking sites and on our website through your direction, and makes your transition between the sites more seamless.</p>

<p><strong>Category 2: Performance Cookies</strong></p>

<p>These cookies collect information about how visitors use a website, for instance which pages visitors go to most often, and if they get error messages from web pages. These cookies don’t collect information that identifies a visitor. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. It is only used to improve how a website works.</p>

<ol><li><strong>10. </strong><strong>What type of Performance Cookies do we use on on our website?</strong></li>
</ol><p>We use Google Analytics to help analyse use of the site. This analytical tool uses cookies to collect standard internet log information and visitor behaviour information in an anonymous form. The information about your use of the website and your IP address is transmitted to Google and is used by us to evaluate visitors' use of the website, compile statistical reports on website activity and create a profile of aggregated visitors using Google Analytics demographics and interests. We also use Google Display Network Impression Reporting to understand which adverts we place on other websites in the Google Display Network are better at helping us attract visitors to our website. To opt out of being tracked by Google Analytics across all websites visit http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.</p>

<p><strong>Category 3: Functionality Cookies</strong></p>

<p>These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features. For instance, a website may be able to provide you with local weather reports or traffic news by storing in a cookie the region in which you are currently located. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages that you can customise. They may also be used to provide services you have asked for such as watching a video or commenting on a blog. The information these cookies collect may be anonymised and they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites.</p>

<ol><li><strong>11. </strong><strong>What type of Functionality Cookies do we use on our website?</strong></li>
</ol><p>With your consent we may place a cookie to remember your preferences (Preference Cookie) so that you do not need to re-enter your details (country/age and language preferences) on our gateway page. This is not suitable if you share your computer with someone else. This cookie expires automatically after 12 months.</p>

<p>We may also use Session Cookies, which are temporary cookies that aid the user journey around the site, and will remember preferences you have selected during the session. These cookies are deleted as soon as you leave the site.</p>

<p><strong>Category 4: Targeting Cookies or Advertising Cookies</strong></p>

<p>These cookies are used to deliver adverts more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign. They are usually placed by advertising networks with the website operator’s permission. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other organisations such as advertisers. Quite often targeting or advertising cookies will be linked to site functionality provided by the other organisation.</p>

<ol><li><strong>12. </strong><strong>What type of Targeting Cookies or Advertising Cookies do we use onour website?</strong></li>
</ol><p>These cookies are used to deliver content that is more relevant to you and your interests based on your previous browsing across the web as well as keywords we may be able to gather from the URLs of webpages from which you accessed this website, your IP address and any search engine used to reach this website. Also these cookies may be used to deliver targeted advertising to you (either within this website or when you visit third party websites) or to limit the number of times you see an advertisement. They stay on your computer unless you delete them and they remember that you have visited a website. By choosing ‘accept cookies’ on the cookie notice presented to you when entering this website you are consenting to the use of these types of cookies by us for targeted advertising. For details of how to opt out of these cookies please see the section below entitled “How do I opt out of cookie targeted advertising?”.How do I disable/enable cookies?</p>

<p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying the settings in your browser. However, you may not be able to use all the interactive features of our site if cookies are disabled.</p>

If you use different computers in different locations you will need to ensure that each browser is adjusted to suit your cookie preferences.</p>

<p>Some modern browsers have a feature that will analyse website privacy policies and allow a user to control their privacy needs. These are known as 'P3P' features (Privacy Preferences Platform).</p>

<p>You can easily delete any cookies that have been installed in the cookie folder of your browser. For example:</p>

    <li>Note: you can easily identify all cookies by searching for ‘cookie’ against this folder.</li>
</ol><p>If you are not using Microsoft Windows Explorer, then you should select 'cookies' in the 'Help' function for information on where to find your cookie folder.</p>

<ol><li><strong>13. </strong><strong>How do I opt out of cookie targeted advertising? </strong></li>
</ol><p>If you see any of our advertising with the this logo on it - you’re able to take control of whether you get these types of ads.</p>

<p>This is the AdChoices icon and is a part of the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance’s (EDAA).</p>

<p>When you click through the Icon, you’ll get information about the companies that provide interest-based ads on the sites you visit.</p>

<p>You’ll learn about how it works, how this type of advertising supports free content, and about other privacy choices.</p>

<p>If you don’t want this type of advertising, you can click through to the consumer choice page to opt out from the companies that participate in the Icon program.</p>

<h3>14. Use of personal information</h3>

<p>We may use personal information collected from you to provide specific services that you request, as well as to provide additional services that may be of interest. For example, we may use your personal information in the following ways:</p>

<p>Marketing Communications. We may use your personal information to communicate with you about our products and services, and those of our subsidiaries, affiliates, and parent companies, and any of their related businesses.

Unsubscribe, access, questions and further information, below.</p>

<p>Marketing analysis. We may use your personal information for internal marketing analysis, for example, to assess trends amongst our consumers or to measure the amount of traffic to our websites. We may often aggregate information wherever possible so that it is no longer personal information.</p>

<p>Transactional purposes. We may use your personal information to respond to your queries and requests, maintain your accounts, and manage transactions such as credit card payments for any goods that you order from us or our agents, or for the fulfilment of such transactions (e.g., delivery).</p>

<p>Forward to a friend. When you provide us with information regarding another individual, such as when you request that we send someone information from one of our websites, we will send that individual only the information you specifically requested that we send. We will not send them additional communications based on your providing us with their information. You must confirm that your friend is of Legal Purchase Age in the jurisdiction where he/she is located in order for us to transmit the requested information.</p>

<h4 class="Chivo-Black clear">15. Disclosure of personal information</h4>

<p>a) third parties to whom you have provided your consent;</p>

<p>b) our service providers and subcontractors, including our affiliates, retained to perform functions on our behalf, or to provide services to us (such as warehousing and delivery; marketing and advertising; credit card and data processing; age verification; software development; website hosting and management; information technology and office services; legal, accounting, audit and other professional service providers; and other services related to our business), provided such service providers and subcontractors have entered into written agreements with us and do not collect, use, or disclose the personal information for any purpose other than to perform such functions on our behalf, to provide services to us, or as otherwise required by law;</p>

<p>c) third parties who, in our reasonable judgment, are providing or seeking the information as your authorized or appointed legal agent; or</p>

<p>d) We will obtain your express permission before we allow a third party that is not an affiliate to send you any marketing and promotional information;</p>

<p>e) a person or entity, including our affiliates, in the event of a sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of substantial assets, financing, reorganization, or liquidation whereby we transfer, sell, or assign to such third party information concerning your relationship with us, including without limitation, personally identifiable information that you provide and other information concerning your relationship with us; and</p>

<p>f) law enforcement, governmental or regulatory agencies, or other third parties in order to comply with applicable law, or where we believe such action is necessary in order to comply with applicable law, or to detect, protect, or defend us and/or other third parties against error, negligence, breach of contract, theft, fraud, or other illegal or harmful activity, to comply with our audit and security requirements, or to audit compliance with our corporate policies, procedures, legal, or contractual obligations.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us at the contact details below.In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your personal information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development. If such a notification is appropriate, we will endeavour to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and, to the extent we have your email address, we may notify you by email.</p>

<p>You are reminded that, in accordance with the Conditions of Use for this website, which include this Privacy and Cookie Notice, you are responsible for maintaining the strict confidentiality of your account password, and you are responsible for any activity under your account and password.

<h4 class="Chivo-Black clear">20. Portfolio permissions</h4>

<p>If you have given permission to receive communications about Diageo brands generally (for example, by opting to receive news and special offers by email about Diageo’s other great alcohol brands), you may from time to time receive communications about brands to which you have not opted in specifically. Information about many of Diageo’s brands can be found at <a href="http://www.diageobrands.com">www.diageobrands.com</a>.</p>

<p>We occasionally may send you communications about brands not featured on <a href="http://www.diageobrands.com">www.diageobrands.com</a> (e.g., new brands). We recommend that you refer to <a href="http://www.diageobrands.com">www.diageobrands.com</a> from time to time as the list of featured brands will be updated periodically.</p>

<p>Providing general permission for us to communicate with you about our brands does not mean that you will receive communications about all of Diageo’s brands. We will only communicate with you about those brands that we think may be of particular interest to you. Any such communications will provide you with an opportunity to unsubscribe from the brand in question and/or from all communications about Diageo brands.</p>

<p>If you have any privacy-related questions, concerns or complaints, please contact: Data Privacy Officer, Global Compliance Legal Team, Diageo plc, Lakeside Drive, London, NW10 7HQ, United Kingdom or <a href="mailto:Privacy.Queries@diageo.com">Privacy.Queries@diageo.com</a></p>
